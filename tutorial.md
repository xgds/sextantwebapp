# Get started
## Install all libraries
With node and npm installed getting started should be only a couple commands away. After cloning the git repository, from within the sextanwebapp folder type

    ~$ npm install

This will create a new folder called **/node_modules** where all the libraries will be stored. This will take up significant(100-150 MB) storage space, but for prototyping efforts that's fine, this will never actually be loaded into the browser.

Next, make sure babel-cli is installed. You can do this typing:

    ~$ babel-node

It should bring up a es6 syntax console where you can run javascript snippets. If it is not installed type:

    ~$ npm install --global babel-cli

## Run the server
All server side code is written with ES6 syntax, however the regular javascript compiler can't handle that yet so we need to transpile it with babel. This is pretty straight forward:

    ~$ babel-node server.js babel-node index.js --presets es2015,stage-2

This should say that it's serving on localhost:3001, and if you are patient enough(or gave your docker instance enough memory), after a while the console will also say that webpack created a bundle in 50 seconds(or shorter, hopefully), and then if you navigate to localhost:3001 you should see the sextant app!

# Underlying architecture
## Back end
With node.js you can do all your back-end development in Javascript(yay, can forget all about python and django!). To create an **html** server we will rely on a server library called **express**. It will take care of the routing of all server calls and make sure to serve the right resources - be they html(aka your index.html), css, javascript or tile files. This routing can be seen at the bottom of the server.js file.

## Front end
### Javascript import... wait whut, isn't that python?
Another problem node.js tackles is your front-end javascript code(the javascript you would include in a script tag in your html document. When you split up your javascript code into several files(which you hopefully do because modularity ftw), the typical way of bringing it together is through a ton of include script tags in the header or the body of the html document, and using some global shared namespace combined with careful ordering of which script tag is included first(dont want to load a javascript file that needs jquery before you load jquery).

node.js comes with some libraries that simplify this process a ton by instead bundling up all your javascript modules in one large file to rule them all.. and hopefully not in the darkness bind them. And instead of making sure that javascript libraries are loaded in the right order and using a global namespace, javascript has a wannabe python import(and explicit export, limiting which functions or variables import statements can acces - which doesnt exist in python, where you can import anything from a file). Except since they couldn't just copy paste python's syntax, they [had to change it a little bit.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) Except this import syntax is only available in ES6 Javascript, which as we remember from earlier requires some translation to be done, preferrably by babel again (ok, I'm lying a little here, nodes ES5 compiler comes with a module loader built in, however the syntax is not quite as reach as ES6 imports, see https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html)

### CSS import... in a Javascript file!
Yes, you are reading this correctly. No more need for style tags in the header of your webpage. The bundlers can normally tackle css files as-well, by just importing it into one of the javascript files. This is great especially when some javascript libraries(aka Cesium), go with library specific CSS.

### Bundling things up with: Webkit
I know of two libraries that can tackle the challenges of bundling and translating ES6 code(and also React, although React has not been added to this project): browserify and webkit. We are using webkit because... just because. It seems to be the easiest to setup, but don't take my words for it.

Webkit requires some configuration: webkit.config.js, where you tell it what syntax of javascript your are writing in (e.g. ES5 or ES6), the name of your output bundle (normally bundle.js, we are using sextant.bundle.js), and some other things. For production you would actually generate a physical bundle.js file, however the way we run webkit right now, bundle.js is served by **express**(remember from earlier? it is our backend server) without being stored physically somewhere in a file.

### Hot Module Reload
If you looked a bunch at the code already, you will notice there seems to be a lot of weird overhead in server.js and webkit.config.js. Although in webkit.config.js some of the overhead configs are for cesium to properly work, the extra code is mostly to take advantage of a really cool feature that the bundling process allows for: hot module reload.

It lets you edit your javascript front end code(in one of your modules), and as soon as you click save, it will rebuild automatically, and on top of that the webpage with the include tag with build.js in it will make sure to reload the new bundled build.js to get the most recent version of the javascript. This save some significant reloading time very time a change is made. 

# Common pitfalls
A couple of things will easily crash things without you really understanding what's going. The most dangerous is forgetting to declare a variable in ES6. You always need to use const or let to declare a variable, and if this is not done the debugger will give you obscure errors that hide the real problem.

# Cesium
All mapping capabilities are through Cesium, the only library to my knowledge that offers the same features as our dear Google Earth(especially the fact that it can render 3D terrain).

## Importing Cesium
### The basics
So remember how easy ES6 is supposed to make library usage? Aka, we'd expect it to be as easy as ```import cesium ``` right? Wrong. 

The Cesium gang seems to have focused mainly on the users that would use Cesium as a script tag include, and not so much as modular code for bundling. Nevertheless, all hope is not lost - there is after all an npm cesium package, and all we have to do is to import every function individually from the source files in the node_modules package, for example:

```javascript
import CreateTileMapServiceImageryProvider from 'cesium/Source/Scene/createTileMapServiceImageryProvider';
```

Yeah, that's a mouthfull, and when you need twenty other cesium functions your import lines start taking up a significant space and might draw down on readibility. To save our mental efforts there is an intermediate file demo_code/cesium_imports.js that add a mini layer of abstraction around all these import statements. 

**Take-away:** if you need to import a Cesium function ([full list of all functions here](https://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Build/Documentation/index.html)), do a search under node_modules/cesium/Source to find where the file for the function is located, then add the import to demo_code/cesium_imports.js, and use it in the rest of your javascript code as you please

### The advanced
With the basics you should now be able to know how to import a certain cesium function. However, to make cesium work there are a couple of other elements needed, but that you don't really need to know about - just make sure you don't delete these items from any of the files. This includes:

1) Some configurations in webpack.config.js
2) Some css imports
3) setBaseUrl
``` 
import buildModuleUrl from 'cesium/Source/Core/buildModuleUrl';
buildModuleUrl.setBaseUrl('./'); 
```

There are probably some other configurations taken care for in cesiumlib.js

## Rendering offline terrain and imagery
Yup, they go apart, because both have their own intricacies. So let's get started with the easiest: imagery.

### Cesium offline imagery
Cesium of the bat will use Bing maps(it highly suggests you to provide your own API key, but as we all know, who does that these days? - jokes apart, this repository has my private key in it, and I should do something to remove it, yup!). However, adding layers of tiles from different sources, e.g.: your own server is quite straightforward. 

// Side note: Im pretty sure OpenLayers has a similar feature - it just wont be able to do any 3D rendering off the terrain.

```javascript
const imageryProvider = CreateTileMapServiceImageryProvider({
      url : 'some_url to a served *folder* containing all the tiles',
      });
```

Yup, that was easy, and you can probably see where this is going, we serve the imagery tiles on localhost and just plop into the 'some_url'. No wizardry here, any gdal2tiles generated tile set will do the job. 

Can you be explicit on how to serve the tiles? Sure! **Express** will take care of that too. We serve any file and folder from the repository public/xxx so that it is available under localhost:3001/xxx. This can also be found in server.js:

```javascript
const publicPath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'public');
app.use(express.static(publicPath));
```

### Cesium offline terrain
Although the cesium syntax for rendering terrain is almost the same as for rendering imagery:

```javascript
const new_terrain_provider = new CesiumTerrainProvider({
            url : 'some_url to a served *folder* containing terrain tiles',
        });
```     

Serving the terrain is not quite as simple. This is mainly because the tileset generated by [cesium terrain builder library](https://github.com/geo-data/cesium-terrain-builder) is missing some information(c'mon you'd think they could have fixed it in the source code, right?), and we have to fill that infor in manually. There are two key elements missing:

- a layer.json file, that describes the structure of the folders containing the terrain tiles
- a top level dummy terrain file terrain/0/0/0.terrain or something like that

Without these, unfortunately the CesiumTerrainProvider will give you errors and nothing will work :(

Fear not however, this has been taken care off by doing some rerouting in the file terrainserver.js, but it pretty much boils down to:

- reroute any call to a terrain_folder/layer.json to the the layer.json being served by express, since this file is in the public folder already
- reroute any call to the dummy file to smallterrain-blank.terrain, which is also already being served by express, since this file is in the public folder

## Using Cesium and functionalities thus far
Once the specific library has been loaded with the import statement as described earlier, cesium can be used similarly to all the sandbox examples on cesium.com. There are a couple convenience functions I have added however, that I think might be useful:

### ViewerWrapper.getRaisedPositions
Although some cesium shapes seem to drape on the terrain, polyllines do not, and if they are just constructed with latitude and longitude, the lines will appear buried under everything else. This function takes care of that by returning a promise(aka, resolves with .then) which gives you the right height coordinate so that you can draw the polyline at the level of the terrain.

### ViewerWrapper.addLatLongHover
This guy adds a little box displaying latitude, longitude and altitude of the point your mouse pointer hovers over. It could use getRaisedPositions to achieve this, but uses a raycasting technique instead (from your mouse to the "pixel" it hits on the terrain). (Comment to self: this also makes me wonder whether there is any significant difference between using the raycasting and the getRaisedPositions)

### ViewerWrapper.addMesh
This is still a little experimental: the idea is that it would show a local filled contour map based on elevation (one color is low relative elevations, another is high), around the gps position of the person. Mainly for the purpose of terrain verification, unfortunately the feature got finished on the last day, and was never tested in the field. 

EDIT: Discovered the existence of: https://github.com/PropellerAero/cesium-elevation-gradient, which could probably fully replace the purpose of this function.

### index.js, LineString
This helper function is a wrapper around PolyLine, combined with getRaisedPositions and quick setting of color options.

### index.js, DynamicLines
This is the "trajectory" rendering function, aka as points get pushed it displays the new point and all previous ones as one line.


### index.js heading
Rotates the map to align with a certain heading


## Interfacing with index.html
I guess all javascript we have talked about thus far is kind useless if it is not tied to actions by the user interacting with the html view. 

Enabling the interfacing between all the function written and index.html is as simple as including any function you want to export in the module.exports of index.js. Since index.js is the entry point for bundling javascript, then webpack will know that it should expose these functions when it is included in a script tag  in index.html

Then on the html page, you simple call the function by typing sextant.functionname() or instantiate a class with new sextant.Classname().


## Configuration
Configuration files are set up in config.  By default, whatever config/config.js is pointing to will be the config file loaded.  If you need to override without changing this link, you can modify it by setting the environment variable CONFIG_PATH to point to the path to the config file that should be loaded.
All configuration settings should be set up in the config file.  When the node application starts, it will print out what config file it loaded.

To set an environment variable in unix (docker), do:
export CONFIG_PATH=./filename.js
You'll want to put that file in the config directory so that webpack will find it.

To unset it, do:
unset CONFIG_PATH

If you want this defaulted in your environment, add that line to the .bashrc file in your home directory.

## Production

We use webpack, so follow the steps described here: https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/

sudo npm install -g --save-dev webpack
sudo npm install -g clean-webpack-plugin --save-dev

To pack it for production
webpack -p
To build it:
npm run build

## Debugging info:
jquery-mobile needs version 1.4.x to have a dist folder in the npm_modules
jquery-mobile depends on jquery version 2. or 1., but will not work with 3. yet.
